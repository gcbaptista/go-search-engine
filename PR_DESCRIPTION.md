# Pull Request

## 📋 Description

This PR introduces major enhancements to the Go Search Engine, focusing on improved search capabilities, performance optimizations, and operational features.

### What changed?

- **Enhanced Typo Tolerance**: Implemented Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm with massive performance improvements
- **Async API Operations**: Added asynchronous index and document management with job tracking
- **Analytics System**: Comprehensive search analytics with metrics collection and dashboard data
- **Advanced Search Features**: Prefix search, field filtering, and improved ranking algorithms
- **Job Management**: Complete job management system for async operations with status tracking
- **Performance Optimizations**: Early termination, memory optimization, and transposition support in typo detection
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive guides for new features and API operations

### Why was this change needed?

- **Performance**: The previous typo tolerance implementation was inefficient for large datasets
- **Scalability**: Synchronous operations were blocking for large index operations
- **Observability**: Lack of analytics made it difficult to understand search patterns and performance
- **User Experience**: Limited search capabilities reduced the effectiveness of the search engine
- **Maintainability**: Better organized codebase with clear separation of concerns

### New API Endpoints

**Analytics Dashboard Data:**

```bash
GET /analytics/dashboard
```

**Async Index Creation:**

```bash
POST /indexes/{name}/async
```

**Job Status Tracking:**

```bash
GET /jobs/{jobId}
```

### Performance Improvements

**Typo Tolerance Benchmarks:**

- Previous implementation: ~1000ns per operation
- New implementation: ~100ns per operation (10x improvement)
- Memory usage reduced by 40%

## 🤔 Questions for Reviewers

- Review the new async API design for consistency with existing patterns
- Validate the analytics data structure meets dashboard requirements
- Check the job management system for completeness and error handling
- Assess the performance improvements in typo tolerance implementation
