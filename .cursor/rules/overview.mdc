# ðŸš¨ Critical Rules (Always Apply)

These are the most important rules that must be followed in all development work, regardless of the specific domain:

## Core Principles

- **Always be coherent with what is defined in docs/CLAUDE.md**
- **ðŸš« NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY OR DEPRECATED CODE** - Remove old code completely, don't maintain legacy systems
- **Run complete linting suite after major tasks** (see docs/CLAUDE.md Post-Major Task Requirements)
- **Use @.github/pull_request_template.md for all PRs**
- **MUST follow [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) for all commit messages and PR titles**
- **Try conventional commands first, use workarounds only if errors occur**

## Rule Organization

The detailed rules are organized by domain:

- **Development**: `development.mdc` - Code quality, standards, testing
- **Git & Workflow**: `git-workflow.mdc` - PR creation, branch management, code review  
- **Cursor Agent**: `cursor-agent.mdc` - Tool workarounds, terminal issues

*These critical rules take precedence over domain-specific rules when there are conflicts.*
