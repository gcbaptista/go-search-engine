# Cursor Rules

This README serves as the main index for all cursor rules. Rules are organized by domain for better maintainability:

## üìÅ Rule Files by Domain

- **Development**: `.cursor/rules/development.md` - Code quality, standards, testing
- **Git & Workflow**: `.cursor/rules/git-workflow.md` - PR creation, branch management, code review
- **Cursor Agent**: `.cursor/rules/cursor-agent.md` - Tool workarounds, terminal issues

## üö® Critical Rules (Always Apply)

- Always be coherent with what is defined in docs/CLAUDE.md
- **üö´ NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY OR DEPRECATED CODE** - Remove old code completely, don't maintain legacy systems
- Run complete linting suite after major tasks (see docs/CLAUDE.md Post-Major Task Requirements)
- Use @.github/pull_request_template.md for all PRs
- **MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages and PR titles**
- Try conventional commands first, use workarounds only if errors occur
