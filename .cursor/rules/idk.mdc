- Always be coherent with what is defined in docs/CLAUDE.md. If any assumption in this file changes, make sure you reflect on it.
- Any change in the API, make sure you also reflect it in the api-spec.yaml
- Any tests you perform against the application, make sure you leave it as you found it (indexes, settings, documents, etc...)
- I don't want any comments related to refactors, only leave a comment if they clarify the code
- After finishing any major task (feature implementation, significant refactoring, API changes), MUST run the complete linting suite as defined in docs/CLAUDE.md Post-Major Task Requirements section
- Follow all linting rules and code quality standards defined in docs/CLAUDE.md
- Use the exact linting commands specified in the documentation for consistency
- Ensure all linting issues are resolved before considering a major task complete
