# Pull Request

## 📋 Description

**What changed:**
Resolved conflicts between PR #2 (modularization) and the new filter system redesign. The codebase now properly integrates both the modular architecture and the new complex filter expressions with backward compatibility.

**Why:**
PR #2 modularized the search service by splitting functionality into focused modules (`filtering.go`, `multi_search.go`, etc.), but meanwhile the filter system was completely redesigned to support complex expressions with AND/OR logic and scoring. When these changes collided, it created duplicate functions, missing types, and compilation errors.

Resolves conflicts from PR #2 and new filter system implementation.

## 💥 Breaking Changes (if any)

**None** - Full backward compatibility maintained:

- Legacy `Filters` map still supported alongside new `FilterExpression`
- All existing APIs continue to work unchanged
- Gradual migration path available for adopting new filter expressions

## 🚀 Deployment Notes (if any)

No special deployment considerations - this is a compatibility fix that maintains all existing functionality while enabling new features.

## 📋 Detailed Changes

### Removed Duplicates

- Removed duplicate `applyFilterLogic` function from `service.go` (now in `filtering.go`)
- Removed duplicate `convertToFloat64` function from `service.go` (now in `filtering.go`)
- Removed duplicate `filterDocumentFields` method from `service.go` (now in `filtering.go`)
- Removed duplicate `candidateHit` type definition (now in `types.go`)

### Added Missing Types

- Added `FilterExpression` type to `services/interfaces.go`
- Added `FilterCondition` type to `services/interfaces.go`
- Added `FilterScore` field to `HitInfo` struct
- Created `internal/search/types.go` for shared types

### Integration Updates

- Updated `SearchQuery` to support both legacy `Filters` and new `FilterExpression`
- Updated `NamedSearchQuery` to support both filter systems
- Updated `multi_search.go` to handle `FilterExpression` field
- Updated search logic to evaluate both filter systems with proper scoring

### Backward Compatibility

- Legacy filter maps (`map[string]interface{}`) continue to work unchanged
- New filter expressions work alongside legacy filters
- Proper fallback and migration path provided
