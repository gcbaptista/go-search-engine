## 📋 Description

This PR implements two major enhancements to the Go search engine:

### What changed?

- **Parallel Multi-Search**: Rewritten the MultiSearch method to execute multiple queries concurrently using goroutines instead of sequential execution
- **NonTypoTolerantWords**: Added a new feature to prevent typo tolerance for sensitive terms (e.g., proper nouns, sensitive words)

### Why was this change needed?

- **Performance**: Multi-search was executing queries sequentially, causing unnecessary delays when multiple queries could run in parallel
- **Content Safety**: Need ability to prevent typo matching for sensitive terms where exact matching is critical

## 🔧 Type of Change

- [x] ✨ **New feature** (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [x] ⚡ **Performance** (changes that improve performance)

## 🎯 Areas Affected

- [x] **Search Service** (`internal/search/`)
- [x] **API Handlers** (`api/`)
- [x] **Configuration** (`config/`)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage

- [x] Unit tests added/updated
- [x] Integration tests added/updated
- [x] Manual testing performed

### Test Commands Run

```bash
go test ./internal/search -v -count=1
go test ./api -v -count=1
go test ./... -count=1
```

### Test Results

All tests passing across the entire project. Added comprehensive tests for:
- Parallel multi-search execution
- Context cancellation handling
- NonTypoTolerantWords functionality with various scenarios
- API integration for both features

## 📊 Performance Impact

- [x] Performance improvement (describe below)

**Details:**
Parallel multi-search provides significant performance improvements when executing multiple queries simultaneously. Instead of sequential execution, queries now run concurrently using goroutines.
